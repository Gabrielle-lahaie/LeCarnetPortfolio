# Projet personnel

### _Extrait du scénario d'un projet personnel_


**INT.  EMPEROR’S QUARTERS — EARLY DAY**
   
   [...] The room is lively. The employees bring platters overfilled with fruits, pastry, bread, cheeses, spreads, and cured or salted ham. Emperor James is sitting at the table and takes a sip of his hot, steamy tea. Adrien enters. 
   
   > JAMES
   > Ah! Adrien! Good morning!
   
   James raises his eyebrows at the newcomer while he takes a seat.
   
   > JAMES
   > Saints… are you well, my friend? You seem quite troubled.
   
   One of the servants fills Adrien’s cup of tea.
   
   >ADRIEN
   >Thank you. *(sigh)* Good morning, James. I… I am doing well. However, we need to discuss some important matters.
   
   The emperor picks pieces of cheese and bread in the different platters to fill his own. 
   
   > JAMES
   > Ah! If this is about master Dalvosen, I already made it clear: it is non-negotiable. People like him are difficult to find! As for lady Porter, you simply were fortunate. *(He pauses to take a bite)* Give him a chance and you will see. I heard he is much appreciated in the north. Did he ever tell you about how he got free of—
   
   > ADRIEN
   > It is... It is not about… this.
   
   James signs and strikes him with a bothered look.
   
   JAMES
   What is the issue, then? I will have you know, complaints from you have been constant since your recent promotion. You do not like me throwing you a nice little celebration—
   
   ADRIEN
   It wasn’t little…
   
   JAMES (cont’d)
   —You do not like your weapon master, you do not like how the council people address you… My dear friend, you need to assert your place and command. You cannot keep whining to me like this. I might be the ruler of this place, but I am not yours. We are equals, remember this.
   
   James notices Adrien didn’t touch any of the food. The emperor points at the platters with his knife.
   
   JAMES
   What are you waiting for, young man? You look all pale, have a bite, it would certainly make you feel better. 
   
   Adrien sighs and gathers some food on his plate. 
   
   JAMES
   Tell me now, before I lose the rest of my precious patience, what is it you need to tell me?
   
   ADRIEN
   I would prefer to discuss this matter in a more private environment.
   
   The emperor raises his hand and dismisses all the employees. Once they are alone, he looks back at Adrian.
   
   JAMES
   Talk.
   
   ADRIEN
   I know who orchestrated the attack on the night of my celebration.
   
   JAMES
   And who might that be?
   
   ADRIEN
   The empress.
   
   James stares at him through a heavy silence.
   
   JAMES
   Pardon me, I thought there was more to it.
   
   ADRIEN
   No. The facts are simple: the empress hired the con women that tried to have me framed.
   
   James grips his utensils making them point toward the ceiling. His jaw is clenched.
   
   JAMES
   And what proof do you have to accuse my wife of such severe charges?
   
   ADRIEN
   I intercepted this letter in her quarters last night.
   
   Adrien slides the letter towards the emperor.
   
   JAMES
   And do you care to explain why you were in the empress’s quarters at all?

ADRIEN
The blue seal on the letter had me intrigued… We both know where these come from.

James takes the letter and reads it. Then he puts it back down.

JAMES
You should not allow yourself in anyone's quarters at any time.

ADRIEN
I was forced to.

JAMES
This piece of paper forced you?

ADRIEN
My duties—

JAMES
Ah! If I understand you well, anybody can venture into anybody's home now as long as they have “duties”? Are you about to visit me as well? Should we have it scheduled?

Adrien frowns. He straightens himself and exhales loudly. 

ADRIEN
(aggressive)
Your majesty, I am the protector of this continent, anything I suspect must be looked into.

JAMES
To the extent of going against the law?

ADRIEN
I am the law.

A long silence falls between the two men. After a while, the emperor gets up.

JAMES
Wine. I need wine.
